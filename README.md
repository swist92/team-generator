This assignment had us focus on creating a CLI app that displays employees as individual members of a team.  We used the code already made available to us and dynamically created the team members in our app.js file using a number of different functions we learned over the past week.  I linked in my team.html link and from there wrote out an inquirer function which prompts us to select our employee type.  From there, the switch case function takes us throught the different types of employees and our inquirer functions prompt us to fill in our answers.  This can then be rendered into our browser from the html file.  It is also important to inlcude a video snippet of the terminal commands being executed so that one may see all of the choices, prompts, and answers of the user in the command line.

Applications similar to this have a real-world use, especially with larger businesses that need to visualize their department's employees and different team hierarchies in a clean and simple format.  This might also extend to school projects for students or as a living page that can be updated for any organization's needs.  

This was a good exercise in further getting comfortable with CLI apps and will be useful going forwards with our projects.
